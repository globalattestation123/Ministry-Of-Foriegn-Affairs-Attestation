In the initial stage all the documents should be attested and proved real from where the documents are issued. The issue place of different documents can depend on the nature of the documents issued.
For attestation of personal certificates the home department or the general administration department are the people who are responsible for attesting documents. Whereas if it is educational documents the education department of the concerned state is responsible for attesting the documents.

Once you have completed all the attestation process from your concerned country then you need to approach the MOFA .The foreign relations and dealing of any country is controlled by the MOFA .The ministry is controlled by a secretary who appointed by the government .This authority is responsible for granting attestation to migrants who are willing to move overseas. This is the final process because one only receives MOFA attestation after you reach that country. This process will prove how much authentic and real these certificates are. The MOFA attestation is commonly used for:
•         Higher Education
•         Residence Visa
•         Migrate to another country etc.

If any country finds that the certificates are duplicate and not original they will not give approval and the person will not get his certificates attested. Also the ministry will take action against the person who has provided with a duplicate certificate. It has become a strict procedure that for every person to travel overseas MOFA attestation is necessary. This will prove the person is carrying an original document and makes it easy to make any international dealing.
